#### DESCRIPTION:

My name is Micha≈Ç, I am from Bialystok, Poland and I'd like to present you with my final project for the CS50 course.

The project is a business website I created for a local cosmetology salon. I created the project alone, from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the process.

The site contains of simple and usual elements. On the top you can see the navigation bar and company logo. The navbar shrinks when resolution is lowered. You can find the functions in custom.js

Then there is the homepage section, about us, treatments catalog, price list, contact section and the footer. All of them were firstly created in the HTML file index.html. Afterwards I was styling each individual class and id in the style.css file.

There are also imported library files in my project. These would be JQuery Bootstrap, Animate.css (wow.min.js + animate.min.css) and Font Awesome. You can find all the images used for the site in the /images directory.

The most challenging and time-consuming parts of the project were definitely creating smooth animations and optimizing the website for all screen
resolutions with @media in style.css. It was also very difficult to customize the Bootstrap carousel to work like I wanted. I've considered different options like Stripe carousel but I couldn't get it to work.

For the contact form I used formsubmit.co to reroute emails.

Thank you for your time.
